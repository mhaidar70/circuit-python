## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
I coded for the board to say hi on the serial monitor.

```python
from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hi")
    sleep(1)   
```

 Wiring is really simple just plug in a USB wire to the board and the computer.

### Reflection
I didn't have any problems with this assignment because it was an easy one.
